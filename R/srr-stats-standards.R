#' @srrstats {G1.2} Life cycle statement found in CONTRIBUTING.md.
#' @srrstats {G1.4} Software uses `roxygen2`.
#' @srrstatsTODO {G1.4a} *All internal (non-exported) functions should also be documented in standard [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) format, along with a final `@noRd` tag to suppress automatic generation of `.Rd` files or [`@keywords internal`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/tags-index-crossref.html?q=keywords%20internal#null) if documentation is still desired.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G1.5} Vignette? *Software should include all code necessary to reproduce results which form the basis of performance claims made in associated publications.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G2.0a} Provide explicit secondary documentation of any expectations on lengths of inputs
#' @srrstatsTODO {G2.1a} *Provide explicit secondary documentation of expectations on data types of all vector inputs.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G2.6} *Software which accepts one-dimensional input should ensure values are appropriately pre-processed regardless of class structures.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.0} *Where applicable or practicable, tests should use standard data sets with known properties (for example, the [NIST Standard Reference Datasets](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/), or data sets provided by other widely-used R packages).*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.1} *Data sets created within, and used to test, a package should be exported (or otherwise made generally available) so that users can confirm tests and run examples.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.2} *Appropriate error and warning behaviour of all functions should be explicitly demonstrated through tests. In particular,*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.2a} *Every message produced within R code by `stop()`, `warning()`, `message()`, or equivalent should be unique*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.2b} *Explicit tests should demonstrate conditions which trigger every one of those messages, and should compare the result with expected values.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.3} *For functions which are expected to return objects containing no missing (`NA`) or undefined (`NaN`, `Inf`) values, the absence of any such values in return objects should be explicitly tested.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.4a} *For new methods, it can be difficult to separate out correctness of the method from the correctness of the implementation, as there may not be reference for comparison. In this case, testing may be implemented against simple, trivial cases or against multiple implementations such as an initial R implementation compared with results from a C/C++ implementation.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.5} *Correctness tests should be run with a fixed random seed*
#' @srrstatsTODO {G5.7} **Algorithm performance tests** *to test that implementation performs as expected as properties of data change. For instance, a test may show that parameters approach correct estimates within tolerance as data size increases, or that convergence times decrease for higher convergence thresholds.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS1.0} *Bayesian software which uses the term "hyperparameter" should explicitly clarify the meaning of that term in the context of that software.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS1.1} *Descriptions of how to enter data, both in textual form and via code examples. Both of these should consider the simplest cases of single objects representing independent and dependent data, and potentially more complicated cases of multiple independent data inputs.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS1.3} *Description of all parameters which control the computational process (typically those determining aspects such as numbers and lengths of sampling processes, seeds used to start them, thinning parameters determining post-hoc sampling from simulated values, and convergence criteria). In particular:*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS1.3a} *Bayesian Software should document, both in text and examples, how to use the output of previous simulations as starting points of subsequent simulations.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS1.3b} *Where applicable, Bayesian software should document, both in text and examples, how to use different sampling algorithms for a given model.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS1.4} *For Bayesian Software which implements or otherwise enables convergence checkers, documentation should explicitly describe and provide examples of use with and without convergence checkers.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS1.5} *For Bayesian Software which implements or otherwise enables multiple convergence checkers, differences between these should be explicitly tested.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS2.1a} *The effects of such routines should be tested.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS2.6} *Check that values for computational parameters lie within plausible ranges.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS2.7} *Enable starting values to be explicitly controlled via one or more input parameters, including multiple values for software which implements or enables multiple computational "chains."*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS2.8} *Enable results of previous runs to be used as starting points for subsequent runs.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS2.11} *Software which accepts starting values as a vector should provide the parameter with a plural name: for example, "starting_values" and not "starting_value".*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS2.12} *Bayesian Software should implement at least one parameter controlling the verbosity of output, defaulting to verbose output of all appropriate messages, warnings, errors, and progress indicators.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS2.13} *Bayesian Software should enable suppression of messages and progress indicators, while retaining verbosity of warnings and errors. This should be tested.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS3.1} *Implement pre-processing routines to diagnose perfect collinearity, and provide appropriate diagnostic messages or warnings*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS3.2} *Provide distinct routines for processing perfectly collinear data, potentially bypassing sampling algorithms*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS4.0} *Packages should document sampling algorithms (generally via literary citation, or reference to other software)*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS4.3} *Implement or otherwise offer at least one type of convergence checker, and provide a documented reference for that implementation.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS4.4} *Enable computations to be stopped on convergence (although not necessarily by default).*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS4.5} *Ensure that appropriate mechanisms are provided for models which do not converge.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS4.6} *Implement tests to confirm that results with convergence checker are statistically equivalent to results from equivalent fixed number of samples without convergence checking.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS4.7} *Where convergence checkers are themselves parametrised, the effects of such parameters should also be tested. For threshold parameters, for example, lower values should result in longer sequence lengths.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS5.1} *Return values should include appropriate metadata on types (or classes) and dimensions of input data*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS5.2} *Bayesian Software should either return the input function or prior distributional specification in the return object; or enable direct access to such via additional functions which accept the return object as single argument.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS5.3} *Bayesian Software should return convergence statistics or equivalent*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS5.4} *Where multiple checkers are enabled, Bayesian Software should return details of convergence checker used*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS5.5} *Appropriate diagnostic statistics to indicate absence of convergence should either be returned or immediately able to be accessed.*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS6.0} *Software should implement a default `print` method for return objects*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS6.1} *Software should implement a default `plot` method for return objects*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS6.2} *Software should provide and document straightforward abilities to plot sequences of posterior samples, with burn-in periods clearly distinguished*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS6.3} *Software should provide and document straightforward abilities to plot posterior distributional estimates*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS6.4} *Software may provide `summary` methods for return objects*
#' @srrstatsTODO {BS6.5} *Software may provide abilities to plot both sequences of posterior samples and distributional estimates together in single graphic*

#' @srrstatsNA {G1.6} ernest does not make performance claims against other R packages, mostly due to a lack of true R-based implementations.
#' @srrstatsNA {G2.4d, G2.4e, G2.5} Ernest does not allow for factor inputs; users provide model information through likelihood functions.
#' @srrstatsNA {BS2.9, BS2.10} Software does not use parallel chains.
#' @srrstatsNA {G2.7, G2.8, G2.9, G2.10, G2.11, G2.12} Ernest does not allow for tabular input, working instead from user-inputted likelihood functions.
#' @srrstatsNA {G3.1, G3.1a} Ernest doesn't presently call a covariance algorithm.
#' @srrstatsNA {G4.0} Ernest does not write to the user's storage.
#' @srrstatsNA {G5.10, G5.11, G5.11a, G5.12} Ernest does not use extended
#' testing tags. I have used "skip_if_*" tags to prevent the
#' CI/CRAN checks from running over certain plotting tests (where vdiffr might
#' fail) and from running all of the algorithmic tests.
#' @srrstatsNA {BS7.0, BS7.1} Ernest always requires a log-likelihood function
#' and a prior distribution to perform integration. Please advise if prior
#' recovery tests are required and how they should be performed.
