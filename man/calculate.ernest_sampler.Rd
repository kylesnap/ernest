\title{Estimate the Log-Evidence of a Model}
\usage{
\method{calculate}{ernest_sampler}(
  x,
  add_points = c("none", "unit", "original", "both"),
  add_progress = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{ernest_sampler}.}

\item{add_points}{A string, either \code{"none"}, \code{"unit"}, \code{"original"}, or \code{"both"}.
If \code{"none"}, no additional columns are added. If \code{"unit"}or \code{"original"},
the parameter values associated with each point are added, in their respective
units.}

\item{add_progress}{Adds columns for the number of calls to the likelihood
function between each iteration.}

\item{...}{Must be empty.}
}
\value{
\code{NULL}, if \code{x} does not contain any iterations. Otherwise, a \code{tibble}
with at least these columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{.iter}: The iteration number.
\item \code{log_lik}, \code{log_vol}: The log likelihood and estimated prior volume associated with
the point extracted from the live set.
}

If \code{log_lik} and \code{log_vol} are well-specified (see details), then these
additional columns are added:
\itemize{
\item \code{log_z}: The log-evidence estimate.
\item \code{log_z_var}: The variance of the log-evidence estimate.
\item \code{log_weight}: The posterior log-weight of the point.
\item \code{h}: Information, reported through the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence.
}

If \code{add_points} is not \code{"none"}, columns are added with names given by the 'ptypes'
argument for the sampler. Points in unit scale have names prefixed with \code{unit_}.

Finally, if \code{add_efficiency} is \code{TRUE}, columns \code{.calls}, \code{.id}, and \code{.sampler}
are added, reporting the number of likelihood calls between iterations,
the index of the point within the live set upon removal, and the number of
updates to the \code{ernest_lrps} object, respectively.

\description{
Calculate the marginal likelihood of a given model and return the estimates
in a tidy \code{\link[=tibble]{tibble()}}.
}
\details{
Nested sampling must generate a series of increasing likelihood values
and a series of strictly decreasing contour volume estimates. If neither of
these hold, ernest will warn the user and return a stripped down \code{tibble}
with no evidence estimates or log weights. In this case, the user should
check the behaviour of the sampler used to generate points, or report
the issue to the package authors.
