\title{Generate new points with slice sampling}
\usage{
slice_rectangle(steps = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{steps}{\verb{[integer(1)]}\cr Number of times to reslice points during
sampling. Must be larger than zero. Higher values increase the number of
reslicing steps, improving exploration of complex or multimodal posteriors.}
}
\value{
\verb{[slice_rectangle]}, a named list that inherits from
[\link{ernest_lrps}].
}
\description{
Create new samples for the live set by evolving a current point in the set
through slice sampling within a bounding hyperrectangle, shrinking the
rectangle when proposals are rejected.
}
\details{
The slice LRPS generates proposals by uniformly sampling within a bounding
hyperrectangle that contains regions of the parameter space satisfying the
likelihood criterion. Sampling begins by selecting a known live point
\eqn{\theta} that satisfies the criterion. Each iteration proposes
a new point within this rectangle via uniform sampling and compares it
against the criterion; if rejected, a new hyperrectangle is drawn such that
the proposed point is on its boundary and \eqn{\theta} is in its interior.
This continues until either a valid proposal is found or the rectangle has
shrunk to the point where no further clamping operations can be performed.

To improve exploration, set \code{steps > 1}, which increases the number of
reslicing steps during sampling. This controls how many times the sampler
reslices points to better explore complex or multimodal posteriors.

\examples{
# Basic usage with default parameters
lrps <- slice_rectangle()

# More patient sampler for complex posteriors
patient_lrps <- slice_rectangle(steps = 3)
