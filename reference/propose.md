# Generate a new point using LRPS

Developer-facing function, used when creating your own
[ernest_lrps](https://kylesnap.github.io/ernest/reference/new_ernest_lrps.md)
subclass.

When specifying your subclass, you must implement this method to define
how your sampler generates new points that satisfy the likelihood
constraint.

## Usage

``` r
propose(x, original = NULL, criterion = -Inf)

# S3 method for class 'multi_ellipsoid'
propose(x, original = NULL, criterion = -Inf)

# S3 method for class 'rwmh_cube'
propose(x, original = NULL, criterion = -Inf)

# S3 method for class 'slice_rectangle'
propose(x, original = NULL, criterion = -Inf)

# S3 method for class 'unif_cube'
propose(x, original = NULL, criterion = -Inf)

# S3 method for class 'unif_ellipsoid'
propose(x, original = NULL, criterion = -Inf)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An `ernest_lrps` object.

- original:

  Optional double vector. Points in the prior space used to start the
  proposal process. If `NULL`, a new point is generated by sampling from
  the unconstrained unit cube (see
  [`unif_cube()`](https://kylesnap.github.io/ernest/reference/unif_cube.md)).

- criterion:

  Double scalar. A log-likelihood value that proposed points must
  satisfy.

## Value

A list with:

- `unit`: Matrix of proposed points in the prior space.

- `log_lik`: Numeric vector of log-likelihood values for the proposed
  points.

- `n_call`: Number of calls made to `unit_log_fn` during the proposal.
