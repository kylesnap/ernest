Calculating $`\\mathcal{Z}`$ challenging, requires evaluating high-dimensional integral parameter space. Nested sampling estimates integral dividing space series small volumes. starts drawing points prior ranking likelihood. least likely points discarded replaced new samples restricted likelihood regions, gradually compressing search space. round discarding shrinks explored volume predictable way, helping approximate integral. approach estimating $`Z`$ offers several advantages methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): Robustness: NS handles complex likelihood surfaces otherwise difficult traverse, multiple modes discontinuities. Posterior inference: run, discarded samples can weighted approximate model’s posterior distribution. Natural stopping criterion: NS can estimate amount evidence left within unexplored prior volume, can stop sampling amount gets trivially small. Tractable uncertainty estimates: shrinkage iteration follows uniform order statistic, uncertainty can simulated using results single run. ernest’s implementation NS offers R users several benefits: Native R implementation: John Skilling’s Skilling (2006) NS algorithm implemented R, Python Fortran dependencies. (C++ used implement included likelihood samplers improve run-time efficiency). Type- size-safety: ernest helps ensure user provides likelihood functions prior specifications meet requirements NS algorithm. Familiar methods: Sampler specifications results stored S3 objects.
