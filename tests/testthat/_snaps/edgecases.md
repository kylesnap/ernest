# Zero-length likelihood fails

    <ernest_sampler> cannot compile.
    Caused by error in `compile()`:
    ! <ernest_likelihood>: `fn(x)` must return a double, not an empty numeric vector.

# Zero-length prior fails

    `n_dim` must be a whole number larger than or equal to 1 or `NULL`, not the number 0.

    `fn` could not be validated as a prior transformation function.
    x <ernest_prior>: `fn(x)` must have size 1, not size 0.

# Fails on character types

    `fn` could not be validated as a prior transformation function.
    x <ernest_prior>: Can't convert `fn(x)` <character> to <double>.

    <ernest_sampler> cannot compile.
    Caused by error in `compile()`:
    ! <ernest_likelihood>: `fn(x)` must return a double, not the string "U".

# Fails on complex types

    `fn` could not be validated as a prior transformation function.
    x <ernest_prior>: Can't convert `fn(x)` <complex> to <double>.

    <ernest_sampler> cannot compile.
    Caused by error in `compile()`:
    ! <ernest_likelihood>: `fn(x)` must return a double, not the complex number 0+0.3i.

    <ernest_sampler> threw a warning during compilation
    Caused by warning in `compile()`:
    ! Replacing `NA` with `-Inf`.

# Ernest fails when ll is flat to begin with

    <ernest_sampler> cannot compile.
    Caused by error in `ernest_sampler()`:
    ! `log_lik` must contain a range of likelihood values.
