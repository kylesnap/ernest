# ernest_sampler errors with invalid prior

    `prior` must be an object with class ernest_prior, not a function.

# Fully verbose output works

    Code
      run2 <- generate(sampler, max_iterations = 2000, show_progress = FALSE)
    Message
      Restored a previously saved RNG state.
      Creating new live points...
      `max_iterations` reached (2000).
